### Model Matching Rules

The model matching works by a number of parameters, these are `CallsignPrefix`, `FlightNumberRange` and, `TypeCode`. These are provided from vpilot,and then are mapped to `ModelName` which is a path to the model. `ModelName` can have multiple values, seperated by a `//`, this offers more variety of what will render.
